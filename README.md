# ToDo CRUD - React + TypeScript + Vite

# Comments about the challenge.

#### Each todo card in design show a title and a description, but the todos in the api endpoint doesn't has any description so for this, I used the title as description and the first word in the title as title.

#### All the logic of paginating, creating everything, and deleting were mocked in local, the not exist any endpoint to simulate that in JSONplaceholder.
